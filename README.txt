Some random programs hopefully to better understand the ramsey cycle in nEDM experiments

rkCircular.py -- Applies a circularly oscillating B field on the x-y plane
                      and a uniform B field along z to a neutron ket state
rkLinear.py -- Applies a linearly oscillating B field in x-y and a uniform B
                  field along z to a neutron ket state
circularFringe.py -- Generates ramsey fringes using a circular RF field
linearFringe.py -- Generates ramsey fringes using a linear RF field
larmorTest.py -- Visualizes larmor precession given a ket state
blochSiegert.py -- Takes a linear optimized ramsey fringes and finds the Bloch
                    Siegert shift as a funciton of pulse time

circularFringe and linearFringe run slowly, and blochSiegert takes eons.
This is because I suck at coding, and to compensate I use a progress bar
